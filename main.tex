\begin{abstract}
    Vertex operator algebra (VOA) clarifies which part of the CFT is \emph{definition} and which part of it is \emph{derivation}.
    This note reviews conformal field theory algebraically. We avoid the formal introduction of VOA, but always bear in mind that there is some underlying abstract definition of the CFT.

\section{Basic ingredients}
\subsection{Kinematical data}
For closed string CFT, one considers dynamics on $S^1$. 

Usually, the Hilbert space on $S^1$ is the Lagrangian algebra in $\frak{Z}(\mathrm{Mod}_{\cV_0})$:
\[
\cH = \bigoplus_{h,\bar{h}}N_{h,\bar{h}}\cV_{h}\otimes\overline{\cV}_{\bar{h}}.
\]
Each $\cV_{h}$($\overline{\cV}_{\bar{h}}$) is naturally $\Z$-graded:
\[
\cV_h = \bigoplus_{n\in \Z} V_{h+n}.
\]
The ``ground state'' corresponds to a special vector $\one \otimes\overline{\one} \in V_{0}\otimes \overline{V}_0\subset \cV_{0}\otimes \overline{\cV}_0$.
Here $\cV_0$ is the corresponding chiral VOA, and each $\cV_h$ is a module of $\cV_0$.

\subsection{Dynamical data}
In CFT, encoding the dynamical data is alreadily achieved by the conformal invariance, as the Hamiltonian (generator of time translation) is a special component of the conformal transformation.

We focus on the chiral algebra $\cV_0$. There exists a map called the intertwining operator $Y$\footnote{This map is usually called the state-operator correspondance in physics books. However, physics books always neglect that $Y$ is an axiom that cannot be derived.}:
\[
Y:\cV_0\rightarrow \End(\cV_0)[[z,z^{-1}]],
\]
which maps a state $\phi \in \cV_0$ to a chiral field $\phi(z):\cV_0\rightarrow \cV_0$. Here $V[[z,z^{-1}]]$ denotes the vector space of Laurant polynomial with coefficients in $V$.
\[
V[[z,z^{-1}]] = \left\{\sum_{n\in \Z}v_nz^{n}:v_n\in V\right\}.
\]

[TODO: fill the gap between the Virasoro algebra and intertwining operator by refering to \cite{vertex_operator_algebra:Wikipedia}.]

The definition of the VOA is precise, abstract but hollow. Since it is difficult to give any explicit examples, we will not dive into its detail so far.

By definition of VOA, there is a specific $\omega\in V_{-2}$, such that $T(z) = Y(\omega, z)$ is the energy-momentum tensor, which is expanded as
\[
Y(\omega, z) = \sum_{n\in\Z}L_n z^{-n-2}.
\]

\subsection{Operator product expansion}
We firstly consider a trivial case
\[
Y(\omega, z)\phi_h = \sum_{n\in\Z}z^{-n-2}L_n\phi_h = \sum_{n\leq 0}z^{-n-2}L_n\phi_h = \frac{h\phi_h}{z^2}+\frac{L_{-1}\phi_h}{z}+O(1).
\]
By definition of the vertex operator and VOA \cite{vertex_operator_algebra:Wikipedia}, 
\[
L_{-1}\phi_h = \lim_{z\rightarrow 0}L_{-1}Y(\phi_h, z)\one = \lim_{z\rightarrow 0}[L_{-1},Y(\phi_h, z)]\one = \lim_{z\rightarrow 0}\frac{\dd}{\dd z}Y(\phi_h, z)\one := \partial \phi_h.
\]
Thus the above action becomes the one that is usually seen in physics books
\[
T(z)\phi_h \sim \frac{h\phi_h}{z^2}+\frac{\partial \phi_h}{z}
\]


We define \cite{Moore:1988qv} the space of intertwining operators to be the space spanned by \footnote{Here we cheated, the right hand side is not the integer expansion.}
\[
Y:\cV_i\rightarrow \oplus_{k}\Hom(\cV_{j},\cV_{k})[[z,z^{-1}]]
\]
satisfying the quasi-conformality:
\begin{equation}\label{eq: quasiconf}
    [L_n, Y(\phi, z)] = \left((n+1)hz^n + z^{n+1}\frac{\dd}{\dd z}\right)Y(\phi, z),\quad \forall n\geq 0,\quad \phi\in V_{i}.
\end{equation}
Here $\phi$ is a primary field. 

This operator is similar to the 3j symbol in the group representation theory, where the solution of the intertwining equation gives the fusion space. The operator $Y$ is what we call operator product expansion. In the terribly written classic CFT textbook \cite{Francesco1997}, the equation \eqref{eq: quasiconf} is implicitly used to ``derive'' the general OPE, infact, \eqref{eq: quasiconf} is the only equation used there. However, it is a definition rather than a derivation. This is similar to the ``comultiplication'' map of Hopf algebras \cite{Moore:1988qv}, which is an input data to define the tensor product of two Hopf algebra modules.

We thus expand the $Y(\phi_i, z)\phi_j$. 
\[
Y(\phi_i, z)\phi_j = \sum_{p, \{N_k\in\Z\}_{k}}C_{ij}{}^{p,\{N\}}z^{\alpha_{ijp,{N}}}L_{-1}^{N_1}L_{-2}^{N_2}\cdots L_{-k}^{N_k}\phi_p.
\]
Here $\alpha_{ijpN}$ and $C_{ij}{}^{p,\{N\}}$ are numbers to be determined.

Taking $n = 0$, we have, on one hand,
\[
L_0 Y(\phi_i, z)\phi_j = \sum_{p,\{N\}}(h_p+N1+2N2+\cdots kN_k)C_{ij}{}^{p,\{N\}}z^{\alpha_{ijp\{N\}}}L_{-1}^{N_1}L_{-2}^{N_2}\cdots L_{-k}^{N_k}\phi_p.
\]
On the other hand, 
\[
L_0 Y(\phi_i, z)\phi_j = \left(h_i+h_j+z\frac{\dd}{\dd z}\right)Y(\phi_i,z)\phi_j.
\]
To make two results match, the power of $x$ must match, thus
\[
\alpha_{ijpN} = h_p-h_i-h_j+\sum_{k}kN_k.
\]

Thus we update our ansatz:
\[
Y(\phi_i, z)\phi_j = \sum_{p, \{N_k\in\N\}_{k}}C_{ij}{}^{p,\{N\}}z^{h_p-h_i-h_j+\sum_{k}kN_k}L_{-1}^{N_1}L_{-2}^{N_2}\cdots L_{-k}^{N_k}\phi_p.
\]

The next step is to successively use \eqref{eq: quasiconf}. 

As an example, we now calculate the case $C_{ij}{}^{p,\{1,0,0,\cdots\}}$. Acting $L_1$ to both hand sides, we have on one hand, 
\[
\left(2h_i z + z^2\frac{\dd}{\dd z}\right)\left(C_{ij}{}^p z^{h_p-h_i-h_j}\phi_p+C_{ij}{}^{p,\{1,0,\cdots\}}z^{h_p-h_i-h_j+1}L_{-1}\phi_p + \cdots\right).
\]
On the other hand,
\[
L_1\left(C_{ij}{}^p z^{h_p-h_i-h_j}\phi_p+C_{ij}{}^{p,\{1,0,\cdots\}}z^{h_p-h_i-h_j+1}L_{-1}\phi_p + \cdots\right) = \left(C_{ij}{}^{p,\{1,0,\cdots\}}z^{h_p-h_i-h_j+1}2h_p\phi_p + \cdots\right).
\]
By comparing the coefficient, we have
\[
C_{ij}{}^{p,\{1,0,\cdots\}} = \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{h_i-h_j}{2h_p}\right) C_{ij}{}^{p}.
\]

Other coefficients can be obtained recursively. Since all coefficients are determined iteratively, they all contain a term $C_{ij}{}^k$, which can be chosen freely and thus define a fusion space.

\section{Minimal model}
\subsection{Verma module}
Each $\cV_h$ is a module of $\cV_0$. Since Virasoro algebra $\mathrm{Vir} = \la T\ra\subset \cV_0$ is a subalgebra, each $\cV_h$ is at least a module of $\mathrm{Vir}$. There exists a lowest weight representation, where
\[
L_0\phi_{c,h} = h\phi_{c,h},\quad C\phi_{c,h} = c\phi_{c,h},\quad L_{n}\phi_h = 0,\quad \forall n\geq 1.
\]
For the simplicity of notation, we drop the $c$ notation in the following. The space spanned by all
\[
L_{-1}^{n_1}L_{-2}^{n_2}\cdots L_{-k}^{n_k}\phi_{h}
\]
is a module of $\mathrm{Vir}$, called the Verma module, denoted by $U(\mathrm{Vir}^-)\otimes \phi_h$\footnote{There exists a strict definition of Verma module, see \cite{Wikipedia:Verma_module}.}.


We define the subspace
\[
K = \left\{\chi\in  U(\mathrm{Vir}^-)\otimes \phi_h: U(\mathrm{Vir}^-)\otimes \chi\cap \C\phi_h = 0\right\}
\]
called the null subspace. Then the quotient space $U(\mathrm{Vir}^-)\otimes \phi_h/K$ is another module of $\mathrm{Vir}$ but with the zero modes removed.

\subsection{Kac determinant}
Let $\phi_h$ be the lowest weight vector. The minimal model aims to calculate when the Verma module $U(\mathrm{Vir}^-)\otimes \phi_h$ is ``maximally reducible''. 

Since $U(\mathrm{Vir}^-)\otimes \phi_h = \oplus_{n}V_n$ is $\Z$-graded by the eigenvalues of $L_0$, spaces with different gradings are orthogonal\footnote{Here we cheated. Previously we do not discuss star structure of VOA. In the following, we assume $L_n^\dagger = L_{-n}$.}. For each graded subspace $V_n$, we obtain a metric parametrized by $(c,h)$, called the Gram matrix, denoted as $M_n(c,h)$. The determinant of $M_n(c,h)$ is called the Kac determinant, which has been calculated explicitly
\[
\det{M_n(c,h)} = \alpha_n \prod_{r,s\geq 1}^{rs\leq n}\left(h-h_{r,s}(c)\right)^{p(n-rs)},
\]
where $p(n-rs)$ is the number of partition of integers $n-rs$, and $\alpha_n$ is the positive constant independent of $c$ and $h$. Here
\begin{align*}
    h_{r,s}(c) &= h_0 + \frac{1}{4}\left(r\alpha_++s\alpha_-\right)^2,\\
    h_0 &= \frac{1}{24}(c-1),\\
    \alpha_\pm &= \frac{\sqrt{1-c}\pm \sqrt{25-c}}{\sqrt{24}}.
\end{align*}

Thus those $h_{r,s}(c)$ are desired scaling dimensions that makes the free module maximally reducible.

We also wish the number of different $h_{r,s}(c)$ to be finite. We interprete the term $(r\alpha_++s\alpha_-)$ term as the inner product $(r,s)\cdot (\alpha_+,\alpha_-)$. Thus $(r\alpha_++s\alpha_-)^2 = \delta^2(\alpha_+^2+\alpha_-^2)$, where $\delta$ is the distance between the point $(r,s)$ and the line $\alpha_+ x+ \alpha_- y = 0$. Clearly, except that when $\tan\theta = -\frac{\alpha_+}{\alpha_-} = \frac{p}{p'}$ is rational, there are infinite points $(r,s)$ that can be arbitrarily near to the line $\alpha_+ x+ \alpha_- y = 0$.

From the condition, we can solve for $c$ in terms of $\frac{p}{p'}$:
\[
c = 13 - 6\times \frac{p^2+p'^2}{pp'} = 1- 6\times \frac{(p-p')^2}{pp'}.
\]
And
\[
h_{r,s} = \frac{(pr-p's)^2 - (p-p')^2}{4pp'},\quad 1\leq r \leq p'-1,\quad 1\leq s \leq p-1.
\]

\subsection{Reduction of the Verma module}
We now reduce the Verma module for each $(r,s)$ by quotienting its null subspace.
